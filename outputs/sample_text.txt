AutoTagLearn: An NLP-Based System for 
Intelligent Keyword Extraction and 
Conceptual Flowcharting in Academic 
Content
By:
Niharika Ravi Kumar 
Roll no: 31 
Guide:
Mrs. Leena Chakraborty
PROBLEM STATEMENT
1. Students struggle with unorganized, untagged 
educational content.
2. Manual tagging is time-consuming and often 
inconsistent.
3. Lack of intelligent resource discovery through semantic 
search.
4. Need: An automated, AI-driven platform to manage and 
recommend academic resources based on context.
 
LITERATURE REVIEW
1. Topic Modeling for Educational Documents using BERTopic
Publisher: Elsevier, 2021
Key Idea: Applied unsupervised BERTopic to identify broad academic themes.
Limitation: Topics lacked granularity and learner-specific context.
What We Improve: AutoTagLearn grounds tagging in actual course/subject modules, 
offering fine-grained, context-driven tags.
2. Enhancing Tagging of Learning Content using Semantic Similarity Measures
Publisher: IEEE, 2021
Key Idea: Used TF-IDF and cosine similarity for static tag matching.
Limitation: Struggled with contextual understanding.
What We Improve: AutoTagLearn leverages contextualized embeddings (BERT) to 
offer richer, more accurate tag suggestions.
